# Zero Day Project

This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer, created as part of the Zero Day project for the School curriculum. The goal of this project is to learn how to use Git and GitHub, create and manage repositories, and work with text files in the command line.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to install Git on your computer and configure your name and email. Then, follow the instructions in the README file to create a new repository on GitHub, clone it to your local machine, and add a new file to the repository.

## Contributing

This project is for learning purposes only, and contributions are not accepted. However, feel free to fork the repository and use it as a starting point for your own projects.
